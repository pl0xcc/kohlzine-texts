Your alarm app rings
While I’m still fast asleep
Go out serve your kings
I've got no promise to keep

You fight the real world war
I’m posting from my bed
You have to pay your car
I’m opening a thread

I’m pissing in a bottle
You have to get a shave
I never have to throttle
You have to play it safe

Just get a little taste
I bet you won’t be sorry
The NEET life is no waste
Oh, Normieeee
